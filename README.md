# Sneiter_Solver
This code is based on wata-orz' codes(https://github.com/wata-orz/steiner_tree).

Original codes is made for  the Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge 2018 (https://pacechallenge.wordpress.com/pace-2018/).
This challenge includes three tracks, but this code is only suitable for track1.
Original codes are written in RUST, So I write this in C++.

Please refer to the original website for details on the algorithm.

## Required
- g++
## How to build
~~~
$ g++ -o ./out ./main.cpp -O2
~~~
